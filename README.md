# Profrolio-AWS
This is a portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed on AWS.

### How does this work?
This is my personal portfolio project. However, this time the main focus is on leveraging various AWS cloud services to achieve the deployment and integration. Through this project, I aim to not only showcase my previous works but also demonstrate my ability to utilize AWS for hosting static websites, using S3, CloudFront, Lambda, and more.
